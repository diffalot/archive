Classes

A Payload contains PayloadFiles and has associated freeform metadata describing
the Payload as a whole.

A PayloadFile describes a single file within a payload, along with its freeform
metadata.

A repository contains many payloads. It can be a RemoteRepository or a Local
Repository

A PayloadInstance is a realization of a payload -- perhaps a directory on disk,
or its instance on archive.org

An ArchiveOrgFormatPayloadInstance is in archive.org format; it can be local or
remote.
