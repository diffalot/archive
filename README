Use cases

* create a payload
  - add files
  - specify payload metadata

* transfer payload from one place to another
  - check availability on destination
  - create repository on destination
  - transfer bundle (files and metadata files)
  - verify transfer succeeded

Classes

A Payload contains PayloadFiles and has associated freeform metadata describing
the Payload as a whole.

A PayloadFile describes a single file within a payload, along with its freeform
metadata.

A repository contains many payloads. It can be a RemoteRepository or a Local
Repository

A PayloadInstance is a realization of a payload -- perhaps a directory on disk,
or its instance on archive.org

An ArchiveOrgFormatPayloadInstance is in archive.org format; it can be local or
remote.

* Payload -- specifies [PayloadItem]s to include and the associated metadata
* PayloadItem -- a file within a payload

* GenericPayloadInstance
  - add items
  - list items
  - metadata_store
  - load
  - save

* PayloadInstance::GenericRemote
  - local_payload_instance
  - fetch_from_remote
  - send_to_remote

* PayloadInstance::GenericLocalDir --
  - root_path 		-- directory containing payload
  - metadata_file_path   -- 
  - listing_file_path    -- file on disk
  - contents_file_paths	-- paths to the actual PayloadFiles on disk
  
* ArchiveOrg::RemotePayloadInstance -- the instantiation of a given payload on the
  archive.org servers.

* ArchiveOrg::LocalDirPayloadInstance --
  - metadata_store      -- archive.org _meta.xml file on disk
  - listing_store       -- archive.org _files.xml file on disk
  - files 		-- the actual PayloadFiles on disk

* ArchiveOrg::PayloadMetadataXml
  - Archive.org format XML stream for metadata
* ArchiveOrg::PayloadListingXml
  - Archive.org format XML stream for file listing

* TmpDirPayloadInstance 
  Specifically locates payload instance in the tmp dir

* PayloadTransferStrategy
  Figures out how to transfer data from one payload instance to another
