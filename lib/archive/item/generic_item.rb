  #
  # [identifier]
  #   The identifier used to locate the item on the servers and provide the
  #   content to the users. When you upload a directory, the name of the
  #   directory is the unique identifier used. Identifiers can only contain
  #   letters, numbers, underscores, dashes, and dots (nothing else!)
  #   All items must have a value for this field
  #
  # [title]
  #   Item's title.  All items must have a value for this field
  #
  # [description]
  #   Item's description.  All items must have a value for this field
  #
  # [collection]
  #   Item's collection.  All items must have a value for this field
  #
  # [mediatype]
  #   Item's collection.  All items must have a value for this field
  #
  # [licenseurl]
  #
  #   You may optionally set a Creative Commons license for your item by
  #   setting licenseurl to one of the values from the list in
  #     docs/archive.org-list_of_licenses.txt
  #   (Or see [Creative Commons' list]:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/location
  #   So, for example, if you wanted the Public Domain license, you would set
  #     item.licenseurl = 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/'
  #
  # [... more attributes]
  #    You can include whatever other fields you like. Some fields will be
  #    displayed on the website. These are specified in the ItemMetadata
  #    subclasses defined here.  Any other fields will be kept in the XML file
  #    and will, in the future, be shown on the website. For a good example
  #    check this metadata file.
  #
  # Example: for a movie called "My Home Movie", showing your first vacation
  # to the moon, consisting one file named MyHomeMovie.mpeg, encoded in the
  # MPEG2 format, with a running time of 2:30, directed by "Joe Producer" and
  # a unique identifier of my_home_movie.
  #
  # my_home_movie = MovieItem.new :identifier => :my_home_movie,
  #   :collection  => 'opensource_movies',
  #   :title       => 'My Home Movie',
  #   :description => 'Our Vacation to the moon',
  #   :runtime     => '2:30',
  #   :director    => 'Joe Producer'
  #
  # The item metadata struct would look like this:
  #
  #       <metadata>
  #         <collection>opensource_movies</collection>
  #         <mediatype>movies</mediatype>
  #         <description>Our Vacation to the moon</description>
  #         <title>My Home Movie</title>
  #         <runtime>2:30</runtime>
  #         <director>Joe Producer</director>
  #       </metadata>
